In the first step, we need to create a database, to create a database, register at mongodb.com

Go to the Database section

Then click on the Build a Database option and create a database from the location of the element, and at the end, it will ask you for a user and a password for the database, which you must choose and save somewhere that we will need later.

<br>

After the database is created, go to the Database section and click on connect the database you created

Then click on Connect your application option

The link that was created is for you and copy from @ onwards and save it somewhere, for example

<br>


  In the mongodb panel on the left side inside the lists, we click on the Database Access option and here we have a database and copy the created username, if you remember we had a password when creating the database, we must copy the username and password and save it somewhere.
 

### Installation steps Enter the following commands in the Linux server in order:


#### If you are using Ubuntu 18, be sure to select Python version 3, by default Python 2 is installed and selected and you will get an error when running the script. But it runs well on Ubuntu 20 and above


```sh
apt update && apt upgrade -y
```
```sh
apt install python3-pip -y
```
```sh
git clone https://github.com/wizwizdev/wizwizxui-timebot.git
```
```sh
cd wizwizxui-timebot
```
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Replace the token and numerical id (administrator) with the following command and then save:

```sh
nano config.json
```

Instead of Token, you need to replace the token you received from Botfather bot
Instead of idadmin, you should get your numeric ID from username_to_id_bot and replace it
instead of license, you should enter username, instead of key, you should enter password, and instead of bn, you should enter the name of the database that you created in the mongodb site.

<br>

### Edit the timebot.py file with the following command

```sh
nano wiztimebot.py
```

Go to line 46 and replace your special link that you copied from the mongodb site between @ and ' and then save.


### and finally run the following code

```sh
nohup python3 wiztimebot.py > serverlog.txt 2>&1 &
```

### It supports the following panels:
```sh
FranzKafkaYu
Vaxilu
NidukaAkalanka
hossinasaadi
HamedAp
```
Important note: It does not support users who have one port and each user must have their own port

<br>

Enter the robot and start the robot


#### The username and password of your x-ui panel must be simple (combination of numbers of letters) because there is a problem with a complicated username and password and the robot will not run, for example:

```sh
username: admin123
```

```sh
password: test456
```

### Use the following command to add a server to the robot


```sh
/addpanel address/path,user,pass
```

or

```sh
/addpanel address,user,pass
```
Example
```sh
/addpanel http://22.33.333.16:54321,admin,admin
```
```sh
/addpanel https://google.com:54321,admin,admin
```

### to delete
```sh
/removepanel addres or /removepanel address/path
```
Example
```sh
/removepanel http://22.33.333.16:54321
```
```sh
/removepanel https://google.com:54321
```

### View added panels
```sh
/showpanel
```

<br>

### Also, if you have a problem running the code, repeat the following command 5 times to stop the process completely:
```sh
pkill -f wiztimebot.py
```
