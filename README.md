<br>


### Prerequisite

- External hosting (cpanel)
- domain + ssl


<br>

## Important note about the address of the xui login panel:

- Due to the limitation in some shared hosts, it is not possible to send requests from the script side to ports other than 80, 443, 8080 and some other ports for cPanel that are for http and https.
- Try to set port 8080 to be sure that it is active on the host, if it does not work, send a message to the hosting support to activate it for you.

#### 1. Open the following link in the browser and download the project


````
https://github.com/wizwizdev/wizwizxui-timebot/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
````


<br>


#### 2. Log in to the cpanel management panel and create a database according to [Database creation tutorial] (README-DB.md)

#### 3. After creating the database, go back to the main page of cpanel administration

#### 4. Click on File Manager

#### 5. Upload the project you downloaded and then exit the extract mode


#### 6. Edit the config.php file

<br>

Get the database information, bot token from Botfather and admin numeric ID and telegram channel (to send user volume notification) from get_id_bot bot.


Get the original ID of the channel without @ (to forcefully lock the channel) and replace it with:

<br>

````
$Config = [
     'api_token' => "",
     'admin' => [],
     'report_channel' => - , // -100xxxxxx
     'channel_lock' => ['']
];
$Database = [
     'dbname' => "",
     'username' => "",
     'password' => ''
];
````

for example:

````
$Config = [
     'api_token' => "365447414:AAFjkjKJHoLKJIOJKLK89jklYwuCU_1IzzCsKJHKQvv",
     'admin' => [2525252525],
     'report_channel' => -3656542000 , // -100xxxxxx
     'channel_lock' => ['wizwizdev']
];
$Database = [
     'dbname' => "wizwiz_wizbot",
     'username' => "wizwiz_hajmbot",
     'password' => '123456789'
];
````


<br>


#### 7. Enter the address where the createDB.php file is located along with the domain in the browser and it should be a white page, in this case your database will be created:


````
https://yordomain.com/wizwizxui-timebot-main/createDB.php
````

Or if it is a subdomain:
````
https://sub.yordomain.com/wizwizxui-timebot-main/createDB.php
````


<br>


#### 8. Now you need to set the webhook, edit the following address and replace the token and address information, then run it in the browser:


````
https://api.telegram.org/bot1/setWebhook?url=2/bot.php
````
Instead of 1, you must enter the robot token and instead of 2, the address: Example
````
https://api.telegram.org/bot365447414:AAFjkjKJHoLKJIOJKLK89jklYwuCU_1IzzCsKJHKQvv/setWebhook?url=https://yordomain.com/wizwizxui-timebot-main/bot.php
````

<br>

#### 9. Go back to the cpanel home page and click on the Cron Jobs button:


- Select Once Per Minute (* * * * *) mode in the Common Settings section
- In the Command field, please enter the following address:
````
/usr/bin/php -q address1 >/dev/null 2>&1
````
- Instead of addres1, you should put the address of the serverWarn.php file and save it. Example:
````
/usr/bin/php -q /home/yourfolder/public_html/yordomain.com/wizwizxui-timebot-main/serverWarn.php >/dev/null 2>&1
````

<br>


#### 10. Repeat the same steps for the warnUsage.php file:

````
/usr/bin/php -q address2 >/dev/null 2>&1
````
- Instead of addres2, you should put the address of the serverWarn.php file and save it. Example:
````
/usr/bin/php -q /home/yourfolder/public_html/yordomain.com/wizwizxui-timebot-main/warnUsage.php >/dev/null 2>&1
````

<br>



#### 11. Then start the robot, give the uuid key or VMESS-VLESS link and enjoy


##### For the notification section of the end of the user volume, the user must log in to his account in the robot to receive notifications, and the administrator must make the robot the channel manager so that the notifications will be notified in the channel.

### When adding a server to the robot, please enter the following address
````
https://youdomain.com:8080
````

````
https://youdomain.com:8080/path
````

````
http://192.180.125:8080
````


#### The following address is wrong

````
https://youdomain.com:8080/xui/inbounds
````

````
https://youdomain.com:8080/
````
