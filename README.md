### learn inistallation

1. Open the following link in the browser and download the project
````
https://github.com/wizwizdev/wizwizxui-timebot/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
````
2. Create a bot inside the Bothfather bot and save the token somewhere
3. Enter the cpanel management panel
4. Click on MySQL¬Æ Databases and create a database
5. Then choose a username and password for the database and save it
6. Then go back to the main cpanel management page
7. Click on File Manager
8. Upload the project you downloaded and then exit the extract mode
9. Enter the address where the createDB.php file is located along with the domain in the browser and it should be a white page, in this case your database will be created:

````
https://yordomain.com/wizwizxui-timebot-main/createDB.php
````
Or if it is a subdomain:
````
https://sub.yordomain.com/wizwizxui-timebot-main/createDB.php
````

<br>


#### After opening, if the following error was on the page, it means that the ionbube module is not active (it is active in 99% of shared hosts), send a ticket to the hosting to install the relevant module, and they will activate it for you without any problem.

10. Edit the config.php file, get the database information, the bot token from Botfather and your numerical ID and Telegram channel (to send the notification of the end of user volume) through the bot get_id_bot and replace:
````
$Config = [
     'api_token' => "",
     'admin' => [],
     'report_channel' => -1000000 // -100xxxxxx
];
$Database = [
     'dbname' => "",
     'username' => "",
     'password' => ''
];
````

12. Now you need to set up the website, edit the following address and replace the token and address information, then run it in the browser:
````
https://api.telegram.org/bot1/setWebhook?url=2/bot.php
````
Instead of 1, you must enter the robot token and instead of 2, the address: Example
````
https://api.telegram.org/botHsMMWOqfNvYwuCU_1IzzCsQ34334/setWebhook?url=https://yordomain.com/wizwizxui-timebot-main/bot.php
````

13. Go back to the cpanel home page and click on the Cron Jobs button:
- Select Once Per Minute (* * * * *) mode in the Common Settings section
- In the Command field, please enter the following address:
````
/usr/bin/php -q address1 >/dev/null 2>&1
````
- Instead of addres1, you should put the address of the serverWarn.php file and save it. Example:
````
/usr/bin/php -q /home/yourfolder/public_html/yordomain.com/wizwizxui-timebot-main/serverWarn.php >/dev/null 2>&1
````
14. Repeat the same steps for the warnUsage.php file:
````
/usr/bin/php -q address2 >/dev/null 2>&1
````
- Instead of addres2, you should put the address of the serverWarn.php file and save it. Example:
````
/usr/bin/php -q /home/yourfolder/public_html/yordomain.com/wizwizxui-timebot-main/warnUsage.php >/dev/null 2>&1
````

15. Then start the robot and enjoy
